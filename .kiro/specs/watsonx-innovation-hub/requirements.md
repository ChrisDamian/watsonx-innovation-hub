# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Watsonx-Powered Multi-Industry AI Innovation Hub is a modular AI platform that demonstrates how Watsonx datasets and governance can be applied across seven key industries: Fintech, Mobility, Healthcare, Education, Agriculture, Aviation, and Collaboration. The platform serves as both a technical showcase and a practical solution for organizations seeking AI implementations with built-in governance, compliance, and cultural resonance through Swahili-inspired and multilingual design elements.

The platform emphasizes a governance-first approach with DPIA principles embedded from the start, ensuring compliance with African and European data residency rules while providing explainable AI decisions across all industry modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Platform Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a foundational infrastructure that supports multiple industry modules, so that I can deploy and manage AI solutions across different sectors with consistent governance and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a unified dashboard showing all active industry modules
2. WHEN a new industry module is added THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate it with the common governance framework
3. WHEN platform metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring data for all modules
4. IF a module fails THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and maintain operation of other modules

### Requirement 2: Watsonx Dataset Layer Integration

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want access to curated industry-specific datasets through Watsonx.data, so that I can train and validate AI models with high-quality, compliant data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing datasets THEN the system SHALL enforce data residency rules for African and European compliance
2. WHEN a dataset is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete metadata, schema, and governance documentation
3. WHEN federated access is required THEN the system SHALL maintain data sovereignty while enabling cross-border analytics
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 3: AI Model Layer with Watsonx.ai

**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to deploy industry-specific models through Watsonx.ai with standardized APIs, so that I can provide consistent AI services across different business domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is deployed THEN the system SHALL expose it through both REST and GraphQL endpoints
2. WHEN model inference is requested THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for 95% of requests
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger retraining workflows
4. IF model bias is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the model and require governance review before continued use

### Requirement 4: Governance and Compliance Framework

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive governance controls across all AI models, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and maintain audit trails for all AI decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI decision is made THEN the system SHALL log the decision with full explainability data
2. WHEN bias detection runs THEN the system SHALL generate reports for credit scoring, triage, and other sensitive models
3. WHEN compliance templates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide GDPR, HIPAA, and KCAA aviation safety templates
4. IF an audit is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete decision trails with timestamps and reasoning

### Requirement 5: Multi-Industry Module Support

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want dedicated modules for each industry vertical, so that I can access AI solutions tailored to specific business needs while maintaining platform consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Fintech module is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide credit scoring and fraud detection capabilities
2. WHEN the Mobility module is used THEN the system SHALL offer demand forecasting and route optimization

4. WHEN the Education module is accessed THEN the system SHALL deliver AI tutoring and governance simulation
5. WHEN the Agriculture module is used THEN the system SHALL provide yield prediction and traceability features
6. WHEN the Aviation module is activated THEN the system SHALL offer safety audit AI and drone traffic optimization
7. WHEN the Collaboration module is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide meeting summarization and translation services

### Requirement 6: Cultural Design Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want culturally resonant visual interfaces with Swahili-inspired and multilingual design elements, so that the platform feels accessible and relevant to diverse African and European audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any module THEN the system SHALL display SVG-based icons and dashboards with cultural design elements
2. WHEN language preferences are set THEN the system SHALL support English, Swahili, and French interfaces
3. WHEN visual workflows are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent SVG design patterns across all modules
4. IF accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL provide high contrast modes and screen reader compatibility

### Requirement 7: Deployment and Scalability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want flexible deployment options from MVP to enterprise scale, so that I can match infrastructure to organizational needs and growth stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Level 1 deployment is chosen THEN the system SHALL support single repository deployment per industry module
2. WHEN Level 2 deployment is selected THEN the system SHALL enable split repositories with separate backend, frontend, ML, and infrastructure components
3. WHEN Level 3 deployment is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide multi-service architecture with CI/CD, Docker, Helm, and Terraform
4. IF scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of individual modules without affecting others

### Requirement 8: Cross-Border Use Case Support
